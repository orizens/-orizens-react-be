## Install React-BE

```bash
npm install --save @orizens/react-be
```

Make sure your project includes bootstrap.

## WHY?

Bootstrap is still popular and along with that, react-bootstrap is as well.
React-BE solves the problem of development experience and adds auto-completion for bootstrap utility functions.

## Usage

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { Be, Row, H4, Section, Flex, Div, Ol, Li } from '@orizens/react-be'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Section>
      <H4 text='dark'>React-BE</H4>
      <Column col='10'>
        <Be flex='row' overflow='auto'>react-be is a time saver</Be>
        <Flex flex='row'>
          <Div>
            <Ol>
              <Li>there are more elements - with FULL Typescript support</Li>
